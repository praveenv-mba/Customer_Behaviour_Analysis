## üß† Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python

### 1. Data Loading

* Imported the dataset using **Pandas**.
* Performed initial inspection using `.info()` and `.describe()` to understand structure and statistics.

### 2. Data Cleaning

* **Missing Data Handling:**
  Imputed missing values in the *Review Rating* column using the **median rating per product category**.
* **Column Standardization:**
  Converted column names to **snake_case** for readability.

### 3. Feature Engineering

* Created an **age_group** column by binning customer ages.
* Derived **purchase_frequency_days** from purchase timestamps.

### 4. Data Consistency Check

* Checked redundancy between `discount_applied` and `promo_code_used`; dropped `promo_code_used`.

### 5. Database Integration

* Connected Python to **MySQL** using `SQLAlchemy` and loaded the cleaned DataFrame into the database for SQL-based business analysis.
